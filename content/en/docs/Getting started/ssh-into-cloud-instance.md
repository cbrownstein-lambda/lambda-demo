For security, we use ssh key based authentication rather than password based.
 
If you're running Linux or MacOS on your local computer, then you can find
instructions for how to set up key based authentication here:

It looks like the interface has changed a bit since that video was made, so
please feel free to reach out again if you run into trouble or are sshing in
from a Windows machine, etc.
